    "Answer 1: Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression model that is used to address the problem of multicollinearity in data, where the independent variables are highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ridge Regression, an additional penalty term is added to the sum of squared errors of the OLS regression equation. The penalty term is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the regression coefficients, and it is controlled by a hyperparameter called the regularization parameter or lambda (位).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Ridge Regression and OLS regression is that Ridge Regression adds a penalty term to the OLS equation. This penalty term is not present in OLS regression. It differs from OLS regression in that it reduces the variance of the model and requires the selection of a tuning parameter."

The idea is that as the regularization parameter increases, Ridge Regression will place less emphasis on these less important features, effectively eliminating them from the model."
