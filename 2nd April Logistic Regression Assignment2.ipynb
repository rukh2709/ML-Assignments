    "Answer 1: The purpose of grid search CV (Cross-validation) in machine learning is to find the best hyperparameters for a given model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV works by creating a grid of possible hyperparameters and testing each combination using k-fold cross-validation. K-fold cross-validation splits the dataset into k subsets, trains the model on k-1 subsets, and tests the model on the remaining subset. This process is repeated k times, with each subset serving as the test set once. The performance of the model is then averaged across the k-folds to give an estimate of the model's generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV then selects the hyperparameter combination that performs the best according to a specified evaluation metric, such as accuracy, F1-score, or AUC-ROC. The optimal hyperparameters can then be used to train the final model on the full dataset."

    "Answer 2: Grid search CV searches the hyperparameter space by evaluating all possible combinations of hyperparameters specified in a grid. For example, if there are three hyperparameters with three, four, and two possible values respectively, grid search CV will evaluate a total of 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 hyperparameter combinations.\n",

    "On the other hand, random search CV selects hyperparameters randomly from a predefined range of possible values. It searches the hyperparameter space by randomly sampling the space, rather than evaluating all possible combinations.

    "Answer 3: Data leakage is a situation where information from outside the training dataset is inadvertently used to make predictions, leading to overly optimistic or unrealistic performance measures. This can occur when the model is trained on data that contains information that will not be available during the testing or deployment phase.\n",

Suppose that we have access to historical stock prices for the company, as well as information about upcoming mergers and acquisitions. If we use this information to train our model, it is likely to overestimate the accuracy of our predictions since the information about mergers and acquisitions will not be available during the testing phase. In this case, the merger and acquisition information represents data leakage, and the resulting model is likely to be overly optimistic and not generalize well to new data."

    "Answer 4: Following are some ways to prevent data leakage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Split the dataset properly: The most important step in preventing data leakage is to ensure that the dataset is split properly into training, validation, and testing datasets. The training dataset should be used to train the model, the validation dataset should be used to tune hyperparameters, and the testing dataset should be used to evaluate the final model's performance. It is important to ensure that none of the testing data is used during the training or validation phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cross-validation: Cross-validation can help to prevent data leakage by allowing us to train and evaluate our model on multiple folds of the data. By doing this, we can ensure that the model is not overly reliant on a specific subset of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering: Feature engineering can be used to create new features that are not directly related to the target variable. By doing this, we can ensure that the model does not pick up on spurious correlations in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use proper feature scaling: Feature scaling can help to prevent data leakage by ensuring that the same scaling factors are used during the training and testing phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid using future information: We should avoid using future information during the training phase, as this can lead to data leakage. It is important to ensure that any information used during the training phase is also available during the testing phase."

For example, a high false positive rate may indicate that the model is incorrectly classifying some data points, while a low recall rate may indicate that the model is missing some of the positive cases."
