    "Answer 1: The Wine Quality dataset contains 11 physicochemical features for red and white wines, as well as a quality rating score ranging from 0 to 10 for each wine. The key features of the dataset are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed acidity: This is the amount of acid in the wine that is not volatile. It can affect the taste and pH of the wine and is an important factor in the winemaking process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Volatile acidity: This is the amount of acid in the wine that is volatile. Too much volatile acidity can result in a vinegar-like taste and aroma.\n",
    "\n",
    "Citric acid: This is a weak organic acid that can provide a fresh, fruity taste to the wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Residual sugar: This is the amount of sugar that remains in the wine after the fermentation process is complete. It can affect the sweetness and body of the wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chlorides: This is the amount of salt in the wine, which can affect the taste and mouthfeel of the wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Free sulfur dioxide: This is a preservative that is added to wine to prevent oxidation and bacterial growth. It can also affect the taste and aroma of the wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Total sulfur dioxide: This is the total amount of sulfur dioxide in the wine, which can affect the taste and aroma of the wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Density: This is the mass of the wine per unit volume, which can provide information about the alcohol content and sugar content of the wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "pH: This is a measure of the acidity or basicity of the wine, which can affect the taste and stability of the wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sulphates: This is a compound that is added to wine as a preservative. It can also affect the taste and aroma of the wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alcohol: This is the percentage of alcohol in the wine, which can affect the body and mouthfeel of the wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these features can have a significant impact on the quality of the wine. For example, acidity and pH can affect the taste and balance of the wine, while alcohol content can affect the body and mouthfeel. Residual sugar can affect the sweetness and aroma of the wine, while sulfur dioxide levels can affect the stability and preservation of the wine. By analyzing these features in combination, it is possible to predict the quality of the wine with a reasonable level of accuracy."

    "Answer 2: During the feature engineering process, missing data in the Wine Quality dataset are handled using the mean imputation method. This was done because the missing data was randomly distributed and the dataset did not contain a large number of missing values. The advantage of this method is that it is simple to implement and does not require any additional data. However, this method can introduce bias into the data if the missing values are not missing at random and can also reduce the variance of the data."
