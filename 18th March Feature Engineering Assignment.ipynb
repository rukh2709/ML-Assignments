    "Answer 3: Some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso regularization: It is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term to the loss function to constrain the model coefficients. The penalty term is proportional to the L1 norm of the model coefficients, which encourages sparsity in the coefficient vector. The features with non-zero coefficients are selected for the model, while the features with zero coefficients are discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regularization: It is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term to the loss function to constrain the model coefficients. The penalty term is proportional to the L2 norm of the model coefficients, which encourages small but non-zero coefficients. The features with small coefficients are less important for the model and may be discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net regularization: It is a linear regression technique that combines Lasso and Ridge regularization by adding a linear combination of the L1 and L2 norm of the model coefficients to the loss function. The combination parameter controls the balance between the sparsity and smoothness of the coefficient vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision tree-based methods: It is a non-parametric technique that recursively partitions the input features based on their importance for predicting the target variable. The features with high information gain or Gini index are selected for splitting the tree, while the features with low importance are pruned from the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting: It is a machine learning technique that builds an ensemble of weak models to improve the accuracy of the predictions. The importance of each input feature is calculated based on its contribution to the gradient descent process of the model. The features with high importance are selected for the model, while the features with low importance are discarded."

    "Answer 4: Ignoring interdependence: The Filter method selects features independently of each other and does not consider the interdependence or correlation between features. Thus, it may select redundant or irrelevant features that do not improve the model's performance.\n",

    "Overfitting: The Filter method uses statistical tests to evaluate the significance of the relationship between each feature and the target variable. However, these tests may overfit the model to the training data and may not generalize well to new data.\n",

    "Limited performance: The Filter method may not perform well on complex or nonlinear datasets, where the relationship between the features and the target variable is not straightforward.\n",

The number of selected features can depend on the model's complexity and the available computational resources.
