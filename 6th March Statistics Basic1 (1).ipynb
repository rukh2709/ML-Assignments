    "Descriptive statistics is used to describe and summarize a set of data. It involves the use of measures such as mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation to describe the characteristics of a dataset. Descriptive statistics are used to provide information about the central tendency, variability, and distribution of a dataset. \n",

    "Inferential statistics is used to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data. It involves the use of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis to test hypotheses and draw conclusions about the population. Inferential statistics are used to generalize findings from a sample to a larger population. \n",

    "Continuous data:\n",
    "Continuous data consists of numerical data that can take on any value within a given range. It is usually measured on a continuous scale, such as time, weight, height, or temperature. \n",

    "\n",
    "For example, nominal data cannot be meaningfully ordered or ranked, so computing means, medians, or other numerical summaries is not appropriate. Instead, nominal data is typically analyzed using frequency tables or contingency tables. On the other hand, ratio data can be meaningfully ordered and ranked, and can be analyzed using a wide range of statistical techniques, including means, medians, correlations, and regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the level of measurement is not taken into account when analyzing data, it can lead to inaccurate conclusions and incorrect interpretation of the results. For instance, if we were to calculate the mean income of people based on nominal data of job types (e.g. teacher, doctor, engineer, etc.), it would be meaningless since the categories have no inherent order or ranking. Similarly, if we were to compare the difference in heights between two groups using ordinal data of T-shirt sizes (S, M, L, XL), it would not be appropriate as the difference between T-shirt sizes is not constant."

Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe a dataset in a way that is easy to understand and interpret.
