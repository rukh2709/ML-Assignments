    "Answer 1: Ordinal Encoding is a technique where the categories of a variable are assigned numerical values based on their order or rank. For example, if we have a variable 'Education Level' with categories 'High School', 'College', and 'Graduate School', we can assign numerical values 1, 2, and 3 respectively. This technique is useful when there is a clear ordering or hierarchy among the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding, on the other hand, is a technique where each category is assigned a unique numerical value. For example, if we have a variable 'Color' with categories 'Red', 'Blue', and 'Green', we can assign numerical values 1, 2, and 3 respectively. This technique is useful when there is no clear ordering among the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of when to choose one over the other can be a dataset with a variable 'Age Range' with categories '0-10', '11-20', '21-30', '31-40', and '41+'. Here, Ordinal Encoding can be used to assign numerical values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively based on the order of the categories. On the other hand, if we have a variable 'Country' with categories 'USA', 'Canada', 'India', and 'Australia', there is no clear order, and Label Encoding can be used to assign numerical values 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively."

    "Answer 2: Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on their relationship with the target variable. In this technique, each category of the variable is assigned a numerical value based on the mean of the target variable for that category. The categories with the highest mean values are assigned the highest numerical values, and the categories with the lowest mean values are assigned the lowest numerical values.\n",
