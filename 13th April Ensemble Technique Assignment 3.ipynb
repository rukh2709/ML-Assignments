    "Answer 2: Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting by introducing two main sources of randomness:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrapped samples: Instead of training the decision trees on the entire dataset, Random Forest Regressor randomly selects a subset of samples with replacement (i.e., bootstrap samples) to train each decision tree. This process generates multiple independent decision trees, each of which has different subsets of training samples. By averaging the predictions of these trees, the Random Forest Regressor can reduce the variance of the model and make it less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random feature subsets: Random Forest Regressor also randomly selects a subset of features at each node of the decision tree to find the best split. This process ensures that each tree is built on a different set of features and reduces the correlation among trees. Consequently, the Random Forest Regressor can capture the important features and ignore irrelevant ones, thus reducing the risk of overfitting."

    "Answer 4: The hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor include:\n",
    "\n",
    "n_estimators: The number of decision trees in the forest. Increasing the number of trees usually improves the performance of the model, but also increases the computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "max_depth: The maximum depth of each decision tree. Deeper trees can capture more complex relationships in the data but are more prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "min_samples_split: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node of a decision tree. Increasing this value can help to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "min_samples_leaf: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node of a decision tree. Like min_samples_split, increasing this value can help to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "max_features: The maximum number of features to consider when looking for the best split at each node. Setting this value to \"auto\" will use all features, while setting it to \"sqrt\" or \"log2\" will use a square root or logarithm of the total number of features, respectively. Using fewer features can help to reduce the correlation among trees and improve generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "random_state: The random seed used to initialize the random number generator. This parameter ensures that the same results are produced each time the algorithm is run.\n",

    "bootstrap: Whether to use bootstrapped samples when building decision trees. This parameter controls whether each tree is trained on a random subset of the training data or the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "criterion: The function used to measure the quality of a split. The two most common options are \"mse\" (mean squared error) and \"mae\" (mean absolute error)."

    "Answer 5: The main difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor is that Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees to make predictions, while Decision Tree Regressor uses a single decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key differences between the two algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting: Random Forest Regressor is less prone to overfitting than Decision Tree Regressor because it uses multiple trees with different subsets of features and samples. This reduces the variance and helps to generalize better to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias-variance trade-off: Decision Tree Regressor has a higher variance and lower bias, while Random Forest Regressor has a lower variance and slightly higher bias. This is because Decision Tree Regressor tends to overfit, while Random Forest Regressor is better at capturing the underlying patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretability: Decision Tree Regressor is more interpretable than Random Forest Regressor because it generates a single tree that can be easily visualized and understood. In contrast, Random Forest Regressor combines the outputs of multiple trees, making it more difficult to interpret the individual contributions of each feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computation: Random Forest Regressor is generally slower than Decision Tree Regressor because it requires training multiple trees and aggregating their outputs. However, this cost can be mitigated by parallelizing the training process or using a smaller number of trees."
