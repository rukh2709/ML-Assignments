    "Answer 1: A decision tree classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used for classification tasks. It works by constructing a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, where each internal node of the tree represents a test on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts with the entire training set and iteratively splits the data into smaller subsets by selecting the attribute that best separates the classes. The goal is to minimize the impurity of the resulting subsets, as measured by a criterion such as entropy or the Gini index.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step of the process, the algorithm considers all possible splits on all attributes and selects the one that results in the greatest reduction in impurity. This process continues recursively until all instances in a subset belong to the same class, or until the tree reaches a pre-specified depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a prediction using the decision tree, the algorithm follows the path from the root to a leaf node that corresponds to the class label. At each internal node, the algorithm evaluates the attribute test for the instance being classified, and selects the appropriate branch to follow based on the outcome of the test. Finally, the algorithm returns the class label associated with the leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision tree classifiers are easy to interpret and visualize, and they can handle both numerical and categorical data. However, they can suffer from overfitting and are sensitive to noise in the data. To mitigate these issues, various techniques such as pruning, ensembling, and regularization can be used."

    "Answer 2: Impurity measurement: The decision tree algorithm is based on the concept of impurity, which is a measure of how mixed the classes are in a given subset of data. Two common measures of impurity are entropy and the Gini index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the best attribute: The algorithm selects the best attribute to split the data into subsets based on how much it reduces the impurity. The attribute with the highest information gain (or lowest Gini index) is chosen to split the data.\n",

The choice of metric depends on the problem at hand and the goals of the project. A good evaluation metric should be easy to interpret, provide meaningful insights about the performance of the model, and be relevant to the business problem.\n",

    "Accuracy: It is the most basic metric for evaluating a classification model. It measures the percentage of correctly classified instances among all instances. However, accuracy can be misleading when the classes are imbalanced, i.e., one class has a much larger number of instances than the other.\n",
