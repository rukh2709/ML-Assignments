    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer programs or algorithms that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as perception, reasoning, decision-making, and natural language processing. AI can be applied in various fields, including healthcare, finance, and gaming. For example, a healthcare AI system could help doctors diagnose diseases more accurately by analyzing medical images, symptoms, and other patient data.\n",

    "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves training computer algorithms to learn patterns from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms can be supervised (when given labeled data) or unsupervised (when given unlabeled data) and can be used for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. An example of ML is a fraud detection system that learns from past fraudulent activities to identify potential fraudsters in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML that involves training artificial neural networks with many layers to learn complex representations of data. DL is used for tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and self-driving cars. For example, a DL system could be trained to recognize images of cats by analyzing millions of labeled cat images and learning to extract relevant features."
