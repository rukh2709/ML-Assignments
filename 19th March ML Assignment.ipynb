    "Answer 1: Missing values in a dataset refer to the absence of a particular value for a particular observation or instance in a dataset. Missing values can occur due to a variety of reasons, such as data entry errors, system errors, data loss during transfer, or simply because the data is not available. Missing values can be represented in different ways, such as NaN (Not a Number), NA (Not Available), or simply an empty cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling missing values is essential because most machine learning algorithms cannot handle missing values directly, and will either throw an error or provide inaccurate results if missing values are present in the dataset. Missing values can also introduce bias in the data and affect the accuracy of the model. Therefore, it is important to handle missing values before training a machine learning model.\n",

However, in a churn prediction problem, where the dataset contains 100,000 instances, out of which 20,000 are churn cases, we may choose to downsample the majority class to ensure that the classifier is not biased towards predicting non-churn cases."

The interpolation is done by selecting a random point on the line segment joining the two instances. This process is repeated until the desired number of synthetic instances is generated. SMOTE can be implemented using various machine learning libraries, including scikit-learn in Python."
