    "Answer 1: Simple linear regression involves modeling the relationship between two variables, where one variable is the predictor or independent variable and the other variable is the response or dependent variable. The goal of simple linear regression is to create a linear equation that best describes the relationship between these two variables. For example, a simple linear regression could be used to model the relationship between a person's age and their weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple linear regression, on the other hand, involves modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and two or more independent variables. The goal of multiple linear regression is to create an equation that best describes the relationship between the dependent variable and all of the independent variables. For example, multiple linear regression could be used to model the relationship between a person's salary (dependent variable) and their age, years of education, and work experience (independent variables).\n",

We can create a scatter plot of the data and use simple linear regression to create an equation that describes the relationship between the two variables. The equation could look something like this:\n",

We can use multiple linear regression to create an equation that describes the relationship between fuel efficiency and all three independent variables.

    "Answer 6: Multicollinearity refers to a situation in multiple linear regression where there is a high degree of correlation between two or more independent variables (also known as predictors or features). This high correlation can cause problems in the regression analysis, as it makes it difficult to determine the individual effects of each variable on the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to detect multicollinearity is to calculate the correlation matrix between all pairs of independent variables. If the correlation coefficients are very high (close to 1 or -1), this indicates multicollinearity. Another method is to calculate the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for each independent variable. VIF measures how much the variance of the estimated coefficient for a particular independent variable is increased due to multicollinearity. If the VIF values are high (above 5 or 10), it indicates multicollinearity.\n",

    "Answer 7: Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable (x) and the dependent variable (y) is modeled as an nth degree polynomial function. It can be used when there is a non-linear relationship between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to linear regression, which models the relationship between x and y as a straight line, polynomial regression models the relationship as a curve. This curve can be of any degree, depending on the complexity of the relationship between x and y. For example, a quadratic polynomial regression model would use a curve of degree 2, which is a parabola.\n",

    "Another important difference is that the interpretation of the coefficients in polynomial regression can be more complex than in linear regression. In linear regression, the coefficient for each independent variable represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit increase in that variable, holding all other variables constant. In polynomial regression, the coefficients for the higher order terms (such as x^2, x^3, etc.) represent the change in the slope of the curve, rather than a direct effect on the dependent variable."
