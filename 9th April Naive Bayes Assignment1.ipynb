    "Answer 3: One of the most common applications of Bayes' theorem is in the field of medical testing. For example, consider a patient who has been tested for a rare disease that affects only 1 in 10,000 people. If the test is 99% accurate, what is the probability that the patient has the disease?\n",

    "Answer 5: Naive Bayes is a family of probabilistic algorithms that are commonly used for classification tasks. There are three main types of Naive Bayes classifiers: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes. The choice of which type of Naive Bayes classifier to use depends on the type of data being analyzed and the specific problem being addressed. Here are some guidelines for choosing the appropriate type of Naive Bayes classifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Naive Bayes: This classifier is used when the features are continuous variables and the data is normally distributed. It assumes that the data follows a Gaussian (normal) distribution, and estimates the mean and variance of each feature for each class. It works well for problems where the features are continuous and the distribution of the data is known to be Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multinomial Naive Bayes: This classifier is used when the features are discrete variables such as word counts or frequencies. It works well for text classification problems, where the input features are often counts of the number of times each word appears in a document. It assumes that the features are independent and follow a multinomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli Naive Bayes: This classifier is similar to Multinomial Naive Bayes, but it is used when the features are binary or Boolean, such as the presence or absence of a particular feature. It assumes that the features are independent and follow a Bernoulli distribution. It works well for problems such as spam filtering or sentiment analysis, where the input features are binary."

    "Answer 6: To predict the class of a new instance using Naive Bayes, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of each class given the values of the input features. Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of class A given the feature values X1=3 and X2=4 is:\n",
    "\n",

The likelihood of each feature value for each class is given in the table. For example, the likelihood of X1=3 and class A is:\n",

    "P(X1=3 | A) = 4/10\n",

    "P(X1=1, X2=4 | B) = 0.06\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to calculate the marginal likelihood of the feature values, which is the probability of observing the specific values of the features regardless of the class. This can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X1=3, X2=4) = P(X1=3, X2=4 | A) * P(A) + P(X1=3, X2=4 | B) * P(B)\n",

    "P(A | X1=3, X2=4) = (0.12 * 0.5) / 0.09 = 0.67\n",
