    "Answer 2: There are several common evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of anomaly detection algorithms. Here are a few of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR): TPR is the proportion of actual anomalies that are correctly identified as anomalies by the algorithm. FPR is the proportion of non-anomalies that are incorrectly identified as anomalies. They are calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "TPR = true positives / (true positives + false negatives)\n",
    "\n",
    "FPR = false positives / (false positives + true negatives)\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: These are used to evaluate the overall performance of the algorithm. Precision measures the proportion of true anomalies out of all the instances that the algorithm detected as anomalous. Recall measures the proportion of true anomalies that were detected out of all the actual anomalies. The F1-score is a weighted average of precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision = true positives / (true positives + false positives)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall = true positives / (true positives + false negatives)\n",
    "\n",
    "F1-Score = 2 * ((Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall))\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve: This is a graphical representation of the TPR and FPR at different thresholds of the algorithm. The area under the curve (AUC) is used as a measure of the algorithm's performance, with a higher AUC indicating better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Mean Square Error (MSE): This measures the average squared difference between the predicted anomaly score and the actual anomaly score. A lower MSE indicates better performance."

    "Answer 4: If the value of epsilon is too small, then the algorithm may not be able to identify clusters correctly. This is because the neighborhoods around individual data points will be small, and only a few points will meet the minimum density requirement to be considered part of a cluster. This may result in a large number of data points being labeled as noise, including points that may actually belong to a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if the value of epsilon is too large, then the algorithm may over-cluster the data and include outliers or anomalies as part of a cluster. This is because the neighborhoods around each data point will be large, and points that are far apart may be considered part of the same cluster if they fall within the epsilon distance. This may result in reduced accuracy in detecting true anomalies in the data."

    "Answer 8: Local outliers are data points that are considered anomalous within a specific local region of the dataset, but are not necessarily anomalous in the overall dataset. These outliers can be identified by analyzing the density or distribution of the data points in a particular region. For example, in a cluster of data points, a local outlier may be a point that is far away from the center of the cluster and has a low density of neighboring points.\n",
